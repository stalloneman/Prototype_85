The purpose of this project is to test the limits of embedded systems computation by attempting to implement a custom, functional operating system simulator on an ESP32 dev board module with custom applications, peripherals, and user interface. In addition to the technical challenge, this project is motivated by a desire to actualize an acute appreciation for retro-futurism, espionage-spyware and hacker aesthetics.
